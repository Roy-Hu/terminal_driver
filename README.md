# Terminal Device Driver Project

## Overview
This project implements a terminal device driver for the yalmix. The driver manages simulated terminal hardware using a Mesa-style monitor for synchronization and is intended to provide practical experience with concurrent systems and operating system device drivers.

## Features
- Implements terminal I/O operations using a simplified thread library.
- Synchronization using a single Mesa-style monitor.
- Supports simulated terminal hardware through software emulation.
